- **Metrics:** Average reliability per data completeness group, correlation between data completeness and reliability.

---

### **12. Reliability by Selection Intensity**
- **Objective:** Evaluate if selection intensity affects reliability.
- **Method:** Group sires based on the selection intensity applied (e.g., top 5%, top 10%, top 20%) and calculate the average reliability for each group.
- **Metrics:** Average reliability per selection intensity group, comparison of high vs. low selection intensity.

---

### **13. Reliability by Trait Heritability**
- **Objective:** Assess if reliability is influenced by the heritability of the trait.

- **Metrics:** Average reliability per connectedness group, comparison of high vs. low connectedness herds.

---

### **15. Reliability by Data Collection Period**
- **Objective:** Determine if the time period of data collection affects reliability.
- **Method:** Group animals based on the period of data collection (e.g., early vs. recent years) and calculate the average reliability for each group.
- **Metrics:** Average reliability per time period, trend in reliability over time.

---

### **16. Reliability by Environmental Conditions**
- **Objective:** Assess if environmental conditions (e.g., climate, management) affect reliability.
- **Method:** Group animals based on environmental conditions and calculate the average reliability for each group.
- **Metrics:** Average reliability per environmental group, comparison of different environments.
